    title: Revitalise your mind
    intro: >
      <p class="text--lg">Time to refresh and reset. Getaway from the every day and experience something new, something to take your mind off the daily stresses and strains. Imagine foraging for local produce in St Ouen's Bay, a favourite for local chefs, with the rhythmic murmur of the tide as your soundtrack. Or, wait for the sun to set and discover a beguiling night-time spectacle. Watch as the beach illuminates with an eerie glow, emitting from strange creatures – this is the bioluminescent beach, once known only to the local fishermen. During the day, don’t miss the chance to explore Jersey’s National Park, where long wistful walks take you through truly exquisite landscapes. </p>

    title: Rebalance your Body
    intro: >
      <p class="text--lg">From hours sat in the office to intense gym workouts, give your body a rest and a chance to rebalance – find your middle ground, away from the pressures of city life. In Jersey, head out at sunrise and cycle along the pretty green lanes of the east coast, accompanied by gorgeous views as you hug the beaches and breeze past old castles. Or, for something a little more adventurous, head out on the waves on a “surfari”, where a local guide will show you where to catch the best waves. Ease yourself into the water with a spot of sea kayaking, taking in the remote and beautiful islands of Les Ecrehous. Round off your day by immersing yourself in Jersey’s forests, where amongst the towering pines you can reconnect with nature and give yourself the chance to rebalance. </p>

        <p>I am Rich Stevens, and I run a RIB charter company Jersey Seafaris, taking people out on the sea exploring the coastline and offshore islands of Jersey. </p>
        <p>I’m a Jersey ‘bean’, born and raised on the rock! I have always been in or near the sea, growing up sailing and exploring. What I do now gives me great pleasure, taking people out on the boat and showing off Jersey’s best bits! At only nine miles by five, Jersey can seem small but it has an extensive coastline which changes dramatically every six hours. I just love how much there is to explore here! Jersey Seafaris has been operating for eight years and we are still finding new spots every year.</p>
        <p>I feel immensely lucky to be doing a job that I love. No day is the same; we have so many types of Seafaris to very different destinations – all dependent on the winds and the tides and what people want to see. Other boat companies in other parts of the world just do the same trip over and over, seeing the same things – but that certainly isn’t the case in Jersey. We have customers that come over every year to visit Les Ecrehous – the stunning islands just off the coast between Jersey and France – and every year the Seafari is completely different. Putting smiles on customers faces has to be the best bit of the job; last year one guy managed to do a day trip from Berlin via London just to get to the Ecrehous and see dolphins. He managed to tick all off the list and was only on the island for about four hours!</p>
        <p>For me, Jersey is an island that punches above its weight. In just 20 minutes – on a  seafari boat trip of course – you can reach France. The proximity can be seen around the island – it has a touch of French flair, mixed with incredible scenery, fascinating history around every corner, and a food scene that keeps getting better – what’s not to love!</p>

    title: Liberate your Spirit
    intro: >
      <p class="text--lg">Jersey is a landscape that invigorates the spirit, from the wild seas to the rich inland treasures waiting to be discovered. Start your journey along the island’s craggy coastline, where cliffs plunge to the sea and create a playground of wild adventure. Coasteering will see you climbing, scrambling, swimming and diving along Jersey’s beautiful cliffs, giving you an unbeatable natural high. Further out to sea, you can try island-hop yoga, with a boat trip to remote beaches that promise yogi serenity like no other. Inland, take a moment for yourself in beguiling surroundings. Jersey’s Botanic Gardens are a beautiful hideaway for a bit of me-time, amongst rare flora and fauna and eye-catching landscaped gardens. </p>
